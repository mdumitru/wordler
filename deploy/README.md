# Deploying Wordler

The image builds the React app and serves the static files with nginx as a
non-root user on port 8080 (IPv4).

```sh
# From the repository root (the build context must be the whole project):
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t wordler .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 wordler
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

The build needs BuildKit (the default with Docker Engine 23+ or the `buildx`
plugin): the Dockerfile uses a cache mount and `deploy/Dockerfile.dockerignore`.

- `GET /healthz` returns `ok` for load-balancer and container health checks.
- Hashed assets under `/assets/` are cached for a year; the word lists under
  `/words/` for an hour; `index.html` is always revalidated, so a redeploy is
  picked up on the next page load.

## Production stack with analytics

`deploy/compose.yaml` runs the game behind Caddy (automatic HTTPS) together
with self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is) analytics and its Postgres
database. Only Caddy is published (ports 80/443); the Umami dashboard listens
on `127.0.0.1:3000` of the host.

Caddy serves three analytics routes on the game's own origin, so the
Content-Security-Policy stays `'self'`-only:

- `/stats/config.json` gives the app the Umami website id (empty = analytics
  off; the app then never loads the tracker).
- `/stats/script.js` and `/stats/api/send` are the Umami tracker and its
  collection endpoint. Every other Umami path stays private.

Umami counts visitors without cookies, so no consent banner is needed. A
"unique visitor" is unique per day; ad blockers hide some visits.

### First start

```sh
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env     # set SITE_ADDRESS, and both secrets with: openssl rand -hex 32
docker compose up -d --build
```

Point the domain's DNS at the server first; Caddy fetches the certificate on
start. For a local trial, set `SITE_ADDRESS=:80` and open <http://localhost>.

Then create the website in Umami:

1. Open the dashboard: `ssh -L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000 <server>`, then
   <http://localhost:3000>.
2. Log in as `admin` / `umami` and **change that password immediately**.
3. Settings → Websites → Add website (any name, the public domain). Copy its
   website id into `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` in `.env`.
4. `docker compose up -d caddy` to apply it. Visits show up in the dashboard
   within seconds.

Redeploy the game after code changes with `docker compose up -d --build
wordle`.

### What the game reports

Besides page views (visits, visitors, time on site, referrers, countries,
devices), the app sends these events:

| Event | When | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `game_start` | first valid guess of a game | `length` |
| `game_end` | win, loss, give up, or New word after at least one guess | `outcome` (`won`, `lost`, `gave_up`, `skipped`), `guesses`, `length`, `maxGuesses`, `seconds`, `word` |
| `share` | Share pressed | `won`, `length` |

`seconds` is active play time: gaps between key presses count up to two
minutes each and time in a hidden tab never counts. It survives a reload.
Games abandoned by closing the tab have a `game_start` but no `game_end`.

### Queries

The dashboard's Events view breaks events down by their data. For medians and
distributions, query Postgres directly:

```sh
docker compose exec db psql -U umami umami
```

```sql
-- One row per finished game, with its data as columns.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW games AS
SELECT e.created_at,
       e.session_id,
       max(d.string_value) FILTER (WHERE d.data_key = 'outcome') AS outcome,
       max(d.string_value) FILTER (WHERE d.data_key = 'word')    AS word,
       max(d.number_value) FILTER (WHERE d.data_key = 'guesses') AS guesses,
       max(d.number_value) FILTER (WHERE d.data_key = 'length')  AS length,
       max(d.number_value) FILTER (WHERE d.data_key = 'seconds') AS seconds
FROM website_event e
JOIN event_data d ON d.website_event_id = e.event_id
WHERE e.event_name = 'game_end'
GROUP BY e.event_id, e.created_at, e.session_id;

-- Outcomes, and guesses and time for won games.
SELECT outcome, count(*),
       percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY guesses) AS median_guesses,
       round(avg(guesses), 2)                               AS avg_guesses,
       percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY seconds) AS median_seconds
FROM games GROUP BY outcome;

-- Guess distribution of won games.
SELECT guesses, count(*) FROM games WHERE outcome = 'won'
GROUP BY guesses ORDER BY guesses;

-- Hardest words (at least 5 finished games).
SELECT word, count(*) AS games,
       round(avg((outcome = 'won')::int), 2) AS win_rate
FROM games GROUP BY word HAVING count(*) >= 5 ORDER BY win_rate LIMIT 20;
```

### Backups

All statistics live in the `umami-db` volume:

```sh
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U umami umami | gzip > umami-$(date +%F).sql.gz
```

## Security headers

`deploy/security-headers.conf` is installed as
`/etc/nginx/snippets/security-headers.conf` and included at server level and
in every location that sets its own `add_header` (nginx would otherwise drop
the server-level headers there). It sets a Content-Security-Policy,
Permissions-Policy, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and
`X-Frame-Options`.

The CSP allows the inline theme script in `index.html` by its SHA-256
hash. **After changing that script**, rebuild and recompute the hash from the
built page, then update `security-headers.conf`:

```sh
npm run build
python3 - <<'PY'
import base64, hashlib, re
html = open("build/index.html").read()
for script in re.findall(r"<script>(.*?)</script>", html, re.S):
    digest = hashlib.sha256(script.encode()).digest()
    print("'sha256-" + base64.b64encode(digest).decode() + "'")
PY
```

A stale hash shows up as a CSP violation in the browser console and a flash
of the light theme on load.

HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security`) is not set here: the container speaks plain
HTTP. Set it on the TLS terminator in front of it; the Caddy front in
`compose.yaml` does.

## Base images

Both `FROM` lines pin an image by digest (`image:tag@sha256:…`), so rebuilds
are reproducible and the tag is only informative. To move to a newer patch
release or another version, resolve the tag's current multi-arch digest and
replace the whole reference:

```sh
docker buildx imagetools inspect node:20-alpine | grep '^Digest'
docker buildx imagetools inspect nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.27-alpine | grep '^Digest'
```

## Dependency audit

`npm audit` (checked 2026-11-09) reports no advisories. The app is built with
Vite; the runtime image ships only the static build.
